# Modular CNT Tether for Space Elevator Deployment
*“Contribute to the feasibility of the first Earth-to-orbit megastructure — a modular CNT space elevator.”*  

This repository contains research and simulation work supporting the paper  
**"Modular Carbon-Nanotube Tether Architecture for Space-Elevator Deployment: Design, Modelling, and Feasibility Assessment"**  
(submitted to AIAA 2025).

## Project Overview
This project investigates a **modular space-elevator tether** architecture composed of repeatable 10–100 km carbon-nanotube (CNT) segments joined on-orbit by nanobonded sleeve couplers.  

Instead of an unserviceable monolithic ribbon, the modular approach enables:

-  **On-orbit repair and replacement** of damaged spans  
-  **Reduced launch mass** (≈35% less than monolithic designs)  
-  **Improved resilience** to micrometeoroids, thermal cycling, and GEO wind loading

##  Research Contributions
- Closed-form tension and vibration envelopes for segmented CNT tethers  
- Finite-element and lumped-parameter simulations of joint failure modes  
- Deployment and logistics models for staged assembly from GEO  
- Repairability analysis showing mean-time-to-repair < 72h for a 50 km module
